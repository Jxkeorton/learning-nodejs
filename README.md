# Node.js full course | 7 hours

A set of lessons created by Dave Gray on youtube through a 7hr long tutorial he goes from the very basics of nodejs through to building a web server which includes user authentication.  I have taken this course with the intentions of creating a MERN stack app.

## What i learned

- Read & write files
- NPM modules
- Event Emitters
- Building a web server
- Expressjs framework
- Middleware
- Routing
- MVC REST API
- Authentication
- JWT Auth
- User Roles | Authorization
- Mongoose & MongoDB
- Async CRUD Operations

I feel ready to take on my own MERN stack project now that i have all the necessary knowledge. Learning the basics of nodejs has really helped to build a solid foundation in the development of a MERN stack.
